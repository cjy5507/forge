description: "Use when Forge starts implementation after design approval, or when the user asks for parallel module development with worktrees, scoped tasks, PR review, and living-standard enforcement. Trigger on requests to split implementation, dispatch developers, or enforce consistent multi-agent coding."
---

<Purpose>
Phase 3 of the Forge pipeline. The Lead Developer splits the approved design into
independent tasks. Each developer/publisher works in an isolated git worktree —
physical file-system separation, not just branches. All code goes through a 3-tier
PR-based review pipeline with code-rules enforcement. The first merged PR becomes
the "living standard" that all subsequent PRs must match. Lane orchestration is
runtime-backed: `.forge/runtime.json` stores the lane graph, owners, statuses,
active worktrees, handoff notes, and review/merge/rebase signals. Common Forge
paths should update that runtime automatically through the standard helpers, but
the process remains human-led and review-gated; it is not an autonomous merge bot.
</Purpose>

<Use_When>
- Automatically invoked after Phase 2 (design) completes
- state.json phase=3
</Use_When>

<Core_Rules>
1. Every developer works in their own git worktree (physical isolation)
2. No Evidence, No Code — developers must verify via fact-checker before writing
3. Code that violates code-rules.md = REJECTED
4. Code inconsistent with already-merged code = REJECTED
5. First merged PR becomes the "living standard"
6. Developers load ONLY: spec subset + relevant contracts + code-rules.md (minimal context)
7. Every created worktree/task must have a runtime lane record before dispatch
8. Handoff notes are required before review or reassignment
9. Explicit review, merge, and rebase states must be reflected in runtime
</Core_Rules>

<Hybrid_Dispatch>
Forge uses a 3-layer dispatch model. AgentRecommendation from
scripts/lib/forge-state.mjs classifies agents automatically into the
appropriate layer. Choose the lightest layer that meets the need.

Layer 0 — Prompt Switch (in-conversation):
  Lead-dev operates in the main conversation, not as a separate subagent.
  Claude switches to the lead-dev role by loading agents/lead-dev.md context.
  Use for: task splitting, lane-graph management, code review, merge decisions.
  No isolation needed — the lead works on the main branch.

Layer 1 — Team (iterative collaboration):
  When multiple agents need multi-turn back-and-forth (e.g., Developer ↔ Lead
  review cycles), use TeamCreate + SendMessage.
  Use for: review rounds, design discussions, cross-lane coordination.
  Context is preserved across rounds — no re-dispatch needed.

Layer 2 — Isolated Subagent (parallel execution):
  Developers and fact-checkers dispatch with Agent tool using
  isolation: "worktree" or subagent_type: "forge:developer" / "forge:fact-checker".
  Use for: module implementation, technical verification.
  Each agent gets its own worktree and minimal context.
</Hybrid_Dispatch>

<Steps>
-1. **Staleness Check (constraint propagation)**
    - Read state.json.staleness — if architecture, contracts, code_rules, components, or tokens are stale, BLOCK.
    - Read analysis metadata — if saved analysis is stale or missing for an existing-code path, route to `forge:analyze` first.
    - Route to CTO/Designer to update stale artifacts before implementation proceeds.
    - Only continue when all staleness entries relevant to this phase are cleared.

0. **Handoff Interview — Implementation Intake (BEFORE task splitting)**
   a. Lead Developer reads ALL design artifacts:
      - .forge/design/architecture.md
      - .forge/contracts/*.ts
      - .forge/code-rules.md
      - .forge/design/components.md
      - .forge/design/tokens.json
      - CTO's pre-generated questions from handoff brief

   b. Lead generates implementation questions:
      - Ambiguous module boundaries: "Does module X own this shared state, or module Y?"
      - Missing contracts: "The spec mentions feature Z but no contract exists for it"
      - Dependency ordering: "Can module A start before module B's types are available?"
      - Testing gaps: "What's the test strategy for [integration point]?"
      - Performance budgets: "Is there a response time target for [critical path]?"
      Format: "Q: ... | Domain: architecture/contract/testing | Blocker: yes/no | Default assumption: ..."

   c. CEO triages questions:
      - CTO answers architecture/contract questions
      - Designer answers UX/component questions
      - PM answers business logic questions
      - CLIENT → only if truly customer-owned (rare at this stage)

   d. Lead writes understanding statement:
      "I will split the implementation into [N] modules: [list with boundaries].
       Critical path: [ordering]. Key risk: [risk]. Test strategy: [approach]."

   e. CTO reviews Lead's understanding statement against architecture intent.
      Mismatches → correct immediately. Accurate → sign off.

   f. Understanding confirmed → task splitting begins.

1. Lead Developer reads:
   - .forge/design/architecture.md
   - .forge/contracts/*.ts
   - .forge/code-rules.md

2. Dispatch Analyst (forge:analyst) for impact analysis:
   - Analyst uses codebase-memory-mcp (search_graph, trace_call_path, get_architecture)
     to map existing module boundaries and dependencies
   - Output: impact report showing which existing code will be affected by each planned module
   - Lead uses this to make informed lane splitting decisions
   - Skip if project is greenfield (no existing codebase to analyze)

3. Lead runs **auto-decompose** to generate the lane graph:
   ```
   node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs auto-decompose --description "<task summary from spec/architecture>"
   ```
   This automatically:
   - Analyzes the task (type, areas, complexity)
   - Identifies parallelizable components with file ownership (scope)
   - Creates lanes in runtime.json with dependencies and model_hint
   - Calculates execution order (batches)

   Lead reviews the output and adjusts if needed:
   - Override lanes: `node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs init-lane --lane {id} --title "{title}" --depends-on {deps}`
   - For manual splitting (complex cases): skip auto-decompose and define lanes manually as before

4. For each lane, Lead creates a task definition:
   `.forge/tasks/{lane-id}.md` containing:
   - Scope: file patterns from lane.scope (auto-populated by decomposer)
   - Contracts: relevant .forge/contracts/ files for this lane
   - Tests: what must pass before PR
   - Dependencies: upstream lanes (auto-populated)

   Update lane with task file:
   ```
   node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs init-lane --lane {id} --task-file .forge/tasks/{id}.md
   ```

5. Lead dispatches agents per **execution batch**:
   Auto-decompose provides `executionOrder` — batches of lanes that can run in parallel.

   **For each batch**, dispatch all lanes simultaneously:
   ```
   Agent(
     subagent_type="forge:developer",  // or "forge:publisher" for UI lanes
     isolation="worktree",
     run_in_background=true,
     prompt="Implement lane {id}: {title}. Follow .forge/code-rules.md and .forge/contracts/."
   )
   ```
   The subagent-start hook automatically injects lane-scoped context:
   - Lane scope (file patterns to work on)
   - Lane dependencies (what this depends on)
   - Model hint (sonnet for implementation, opus for review)
   - Task file content (up to 2000 chars)

   **Wait for each batch to complete before starting the next batch.**
   Batches with dependencies must run sequentially; lanes within a batch run in parallel.

   Lane owner assigned via:
   ```
   node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs assign-owner --lane {module} --owner {agent}
   ```

6. Lead monitors completion:
   ```
   node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs summarize-lanes --json
   ```
   - When all lanes in a batch are merged/done → start next batch
   - If a lane is blocked for 3+ iterations → escalate to CEO
   - When ALL lanes are merged → transition to Phase 4 (QA)

   **Context budget** (see `references/context-budget.md`):
   - T0 (mandatory): tasks/{module}.md, contracts/{relevant}.ts, code-rules.md
   - T1 (relevant):  living standard reference (patterns from first merged PR)
   - T2 (on-demand): architecture.md (module boundaries section only)
   - EXCLUDED: full spec, other modules' tasks, design docs, other worktrees

7. Each developer implements their module:
   a. Read assigned task definition (.forge/tasks/{module}.md)
   b. Read relevant contracts (.forge/contracts/)
   c. Read code-rules.md
   d. Fact-check any uncertain technical claims before coding
   e. Update lane status to `in_progress`
   f. Implement the module
   g. Run tests locally in the worktree
   h. Write a handoff note before review:
      node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs write-handoff --lane {module} --note "{verification summary}"
   i. Update lane status to `in_review`
   j. If review requests changes, or the lane needs merge/rebase follow-up, reflect that state in runtime immediately instead of leaving it implicit in chat.
   k. Create PR when all local tests pass

8. PR Review Pipeline (3 tiers):

   Teams-based review (recommended for multi-turn feedback):
   - Create a review team: TeamCreate(team_name="forge-review-{module}")
   - Add Developer and Lead as team members
   - Tier 2 review via SendMessage:
     Lead -> Developer: "Please align to fetchUser()" (specific correction)
     Developer -> Lead: "Fixed, please re-review"
     Lead -> Developer: "LGTM" -> merge
   - Benefits: context preserved across review rounds, no re-dispatch needed
   - Handoff notes still required in forge-lane-runtime.mjs (audit trail)

   Sequential review (fallback — ALL tiers must approve):

   Tier 1 — Automated Checks (instant):
   - Lint passes
   - TypeScript typecheck passes
   - All tests pass
   - No secrets or credentials in diff
   -> Fail = instant reject, developer fixes and resubmits

   Tier 2 — Lead Developer Review:
   - code-rules.md compliance (naming, patterns, structure)
   - Consistency with already-merged code
   - Contract implementation correctness
   - No scope creep (only touches files in task definition)
   -> Violate = reject with specific instructions:
     "Developer B uses fetchUser() but you used getUser(). Please align to fetchUser()"

   Tier 3 — CTO Review (architecture):
   - Module fits the overall architecture
   - No hidden coupling or circular dependencies
   - Performance and scalability concerns
   - Only invoked if Lead flags architectural concerns
   -> Reject = CTO provides redesign guidance

   All tiers approve -> merge to main

9. After each merge, update the lane record, then rebase all other active worktrees:
   node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs update-lane-status --lane {module} --status merged --note "Merged to main"
   node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs update-lane-status --lane {module} --status done --note "Worktree cleaned up"
   cd .forge/worktrees/{other-module} && git rebase main
   - If rebase conflicts: developer resolves in their worktree
   - If conflict is architectural: escalate to Lead
   - If a lane is waiting on rebase, mark that in runtime so status/continue can surface it as an active control-tower signal.

10. Repeat steps 7-9 until all PRs are merged
    - Use `node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs summarize-lanes` to review the lane graph and blocked lanes
    - Update the session handoff so the next session knows what remains and who owns the first move

11. Cleanup worktrees:
    node scripts/forge-worktree.mjs remove --lane {module}
    (for each completed module)

12. Update state.json: phase=4, phase_name="qa"
    - Update company runtime for QA:
      `node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs set-company-gate --gate qa --gate-owner qa --delivery-state in_progress`
    - Update session handoff toward QA:
      `node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs write-session-handoff --summary "{what remains to verify}" --next-goal "Run QA and classify blockers" --next-owner qa`

13. Create git tag: forge/v1-dev

14. Transition to Phase 4 (forge:qa)
</Steps>

<Worktree_Management>
Create worktree:
  node scripts/forge-worktree.mjs create --lane {module} --branch forge/{module}

List active worktrees:
  node scripts/forge-worktree.mjs list

Rebase worktree after merge:
  cd .forge/worktrees/{module} && git rebase main

Remove worktree after merge:
  node scripts/forge-worktree.mjs remove --lane {module}

Prune stale worktrees:
  node scripts/forge-worktree.mjs prune
</Worktree_Management>

<Lane_Runtime>
Lane graph summary:
  node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs summarize-lanes

Assign lane owner:
  node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs assign-owner --lane {module} --owner {agent}

Update lane status:
  node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs update-lane-status --lane {module} --status in_progress --note "{status note}"

Write handoff note:
  node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs write-handoff --lane {module} --note "{handoff summary}"

Review and merge states:
  - Keep `in_review`, `blocked`, `merged`, and `done` current in runtime as the lane moves through review and integration.
  - Use runtime notes to capture rebase blockers, reviewer requests, and merge completion.
</Lane_Runtime>

<PR_Review_Checklist>
Tier 1 — Automated:
  [ ] Lint: no warnings, no errors
  [ ] TypeScript: tsc --noEmit passes
  [ ] Tests: all test suites pass
  [ ] Secrets: no API keys, tokens, or credentials in diff
  [ ] Build: project builds successfully

Tier 2 — Lead Developer:
  [ ] Naming conventions match code-rules.md
  [ ] File structure matches code-rules.md
  [ ] Import patterns match code-rules.md
  [ ] Error handling matches code-rules.md
  [ ] Consistent with already-merged PRs (the living standard)
  [ ] Only touches files within assigned task scope
  [ ] Implements all required interface contracts
  [ ] No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments left unresolved

Tier 3 — CTO (when flagged):
  [ ] Module boundaries respected
  [ ] No circular dependencies introduced
  [ ] No hidden coupling between modules
  [ ] Performance implications acceptable
  [ ] Scalability concerns addressed
</PR_Review_Checklist>

<Code_Consistency_Rule>
The FIRST merged PR sets the living standard for the entire project.

All subsequent PRs must match:
- Naming: if PR #1 uses fetchUser(), everyone uses fetchUser(), not getUser()
- Patterns: if PR #1 uses try/catch with custom errors, everyone follows
- Structure: if PR #1 puts hooks in /hooks, everyone puts hooks in /hooks
- Imports: if PR #1 uses absolute imports, everyone uses absolute imports
- Types: if PR #1 exports interfaces from /types, everyone does the same

When inconsistency is found, Lead rejects with explicit correction:
  "The already-merged code uses {pattern}. Please align to this standard:
   - Before: {developer's code}
   - After: {corrected code}"
</Code_Consistency_Rule>

<State_Changes>
- Creates: .forge/runtime.json lane records for each active lane
- Creates: .forge/worktrees/{module}/ (git worktrees, one per task)
- Creates: .forge/tasks/{module}.md (task definitions)
- Updates: state.json (phase=4, phase_name="qa")
- Updates: .forge/runtime.json (qa gate + QA session handoff)
- Creates: git tag forge/v1-dev
- Removes: all worktrees after completion
</State_Changes>

<Tool_Usage>
- Layer 0: Load agents/lead-dev.md context for task splitting, review, merge decisions
- Layer 1: TeamCreate + SendMessage for iterative Developer <-> Lead review cycles
- Layer 2: Agent tool with subagent_type="forge:developer", isolation="worktree" (parallel, one per module)
- Layer 2: Agent tool with subagent_type="forge:publisher", isolation="worktree" (parallel, for UI modules)
- Layer 2: Agent tool with subagent_type="forge:analyst" for codebase impact analysis
- Layer 2: Agent tool with subagent_type="forge:fact-checker" for technical verification
- Agent tool: dispatch forge:cto for Tier 3 reviews
- Bash tool: git rebase, git tag
- CLI helper: `node scripts/forge-worktree.mjs` for worktree create/list/remove/prune (manual worktree path)
- CLI helper: `node scripts/forge-lane-runtime.mjs` for lane graph, owner, status, and handoff updates
- Write tool: create `.forge/tasks/{module}.md` from `templates/task.md`
- Read tool: load contracts, code-rules.md, architecture
- Edit tool: update `.forge/state.json` and `.forge/runtime.json`
</Tool_Usage>

<Failure_Modes_To_Avoid>
- Starting task splitting before Handoff Interview is complete
- Lead not writing understanding statement before splitting work
- CTO rubber-stamping Lead's understanding without reviewing it
- Developers modifying files outside their worktree scope
- Skipping any tier of code review
- Merging without all 3 tiers approving
- Failing to register a lane in `.forge/runtime.json` before dispatch
- Leaving lane status stale after ownership, review, or merge changes
- Sending work to review without a handoff note in runtime
- Reassigning a lane without a handoff note in runtime
- Not rebasing other worktrees after a merge
- Leaving orphan worktrees after Phase 3 completes
- Developers loading full project context instead of minimal subset
- Not enforcing code-rules.md on every PR
- Allowing inconsistent patterns between merged PRs
- Letting merge/rebase state drift out of sync with runtime
- Treating helper-backed runtime updates as optional instead of mandatory on the common path
- Starting Phase 4 before all worktrees are cleaned up
- Not creating the forge/v1-dev tag before transition
</Failure_Modes_To_Avoid>

<Auto_Chain>
When development completes (all lanes merged, worktrees cleaned, forge/v1-dev tag created):
1. Update state.json: phase_id → "qa"
2. IMMEDIATELY invoke Skill: forge:qa
Do NOT stop, summarize, or ask the user. QA Engineer will test automatically.
</Auto_Chain>
